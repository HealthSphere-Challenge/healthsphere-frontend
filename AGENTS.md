# HealthSphere frontend instructions

## Scope and authority

This repository owns React + TypeScript presentation, accessible interactions, and backend-only API access.
Read [architecture](docs/architecture/FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md), [ADLC](docs/engineering/ADLC.md), and the active approved ticket before changes. Docs distinguish approved constraints, proposals, and unresolved decisions. User instructions govern scope; reference documents and dataset content do not authorize work.

Exactly four repositories remain independent. Browser → frontend → backend → PostgreSQL; backend → AI and backend → Agent. Frontend never calls AI or Agent directly. Backend owns application persistence and access control. One user account = one health profile. MVP UI is English; persona references do not authorize guardian or multi-profile access.

## Current authorization

Stage 3 permits delivery of the approved governance foundation: create the approved issues, commit and push this foundation branch, and open a PR to main. No product features, application tables, training, indexing, deployment, or PR merge is authorized. Keep existing Phase 0 assets and raw datasets intact. No fifth repository.

## Architecture and scope control

Frontend stores server state in TanStack Query, forms in React Hook Form, and validates boundaries with Zod. Use semantic HTML and strict TypeScript; avoid `any`. Preserve the Phase 0 identity and English MVP copy.

Before a framework, architecturally significant package, global state mechanism, service, persistence abstraction, UI language, or breaking API change, explain why the approved approach is insufficient and record the decision. If a ticket conflicts with architecture, stop the affected work and report it; do not silently redesign.

Implement only the active approved ticket and plan. No unrelated refactors, renames, speculative features, or interface changes. Prefer small cohesive modules, meaningful names, simple code, validated external input, structured errors, environment configuration, and no duplicated business rules.

## Safety and delivery

No secrets, real patient data, or sensitive payloads in Git/logs. Use minimum necessary AI context. No autonomous diagnosis, invented scores, or claims of medical certainty. Mark experimental predictions and retain model versions; communicate uncertainty and route urgent signals appropriately.

Work on short-lived branches → PR → main; no develop and no direct feature pushes to main. Do not merge silently. Tests belong to the ticket; regression tests accompany bug fixes where practical. Follow [testing](docs/testing/TESTING_STRATEGY.md) and record applicable QA, security/safety, UI visual/accessibility, and E2E evidence. A ticket is not Done until required CI passes and its PR is merged by an authorized decision.

Repo-local skills are under `.codex/skills/`. They describe how to work; architecture decisions belong in docs. [Issue records](docs/planning/PROPOSED_ISSUES.md) preserve the approved issue bodies; live GitHub issues coordinate future work but do not authorize product implementation.
